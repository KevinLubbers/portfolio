# My Portfolio
The purpose of this project is to provide code, video, and written explaination for some of the projects I have worked on


This website was built with HTML and CSS. That's it. 

I wanted to showcase how semantic HTML and basic CSS can be beautiful. My day-to-day deals with huge projects with tons of dependencies, so I decided on a change of pace with this one. Super small file size (minus the videos :D)

Steps of this automation:
  1. Log into manufacturer website with username and password (stored securely in a password manager)
  2. Retrieve MFA code from email and paste into web form
  3. Loop through every selection of every dropdown (4 dropdowns total)
  4. Each dropdown selection populates the data of the next dropdown
  5. Extract data from the 4th dropdown's HTML (a URL and a date)
