# My Portfolio
The purpose of this project is to provide code, video, and written explaination for some of the projects I have worked on


This website was built with HTML and CSS. That's it. 

I wanted to showcase how semantic HTML and basic CSS can be beautiful. My day-to-day deals with huge projects with tons of dependencies, so I decided on a change of pace with this one. Super small file size (minus the videos :D)
